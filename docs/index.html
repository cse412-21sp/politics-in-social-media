Social media accounts have become a prevalent tool for many US politicians. By examining their posts, we
determined that most contained neutral messages aimed at their national constituency, regardless of party. Several
factors seemed to be correlated with more neutrality of posts, including using Facebook as a platform and containing
words such as “love” and “thank.” Other factors seemed to correlate with attack messages, such as coming from states
like Kentucky and Louisiana, utilizing words like “hurt” and “cant,” and having more nouns in their text.</p><p>Taken together, it is clear that many factors correlate with the message of online posts. We hope that by learning more
about these patterns, you are better equipped to think about the purpose of the language used by
politicians online.</p><h2 id="sources">Sources</h2><p><span>Politcal Social Media Posts Dataset: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/political-social-media-posts">https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/political-social-media-posts</a></span></p><p><span>US Politicians Twitter Dataset: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/us-politicians-twitter-dataset">https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/us-politicians-twitter-dataset</a></span></p></div></div></div></div>
