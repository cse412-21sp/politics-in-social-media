I color
 coded the names as to show the typical political party representations (red for Republicans,
 blue for Democrats). The size of each politician’s name is scaled to the number of posts.
 If you hover over each name, you will see the number of posts and also a list of some of their
 posts (it shows all the posts that are unique from each politician as some posts are the same in
 content). Right now, I think the list of posts could be cleaned up so you can read the entire post.</p><br/><hr/><br/><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/shared/Q6PQNZN63?:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="1010"></iframe><h3 id="position-and-party">Position and Party</h3><p>Representatives and Senators are the two main groups for the United States Congress. The first three pie charts
represent the distribution of tweets for the two positions. The distribution is similar to each
other, which implies that there is not a difference between tweets of Representatives and Senators.</p><p>From the distribution, the tweets are mainly neutral, are meant for the national audience, and have
the three main message types as policy, personal, and support. There are more Representatives in
comparison to Senators which could be a factor in why there are more tweets by Representatives.</p><p>The final pie chart demonstrates how political party is correlated with the bias of posts. As shown,
both parties sent primarily neutral messages, though the Republican party seemed to post more messages
that were classified as partisan.</p><br/><hr/><br/><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/twitter_vs_facebook/Sheet1?:language=en&amp;:display_count=y&amp;publish=yes&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="600"></iframe><h3 id="use-of-message-based-on-source-and-bias">Use of message based on source and bias</h3><p>The sources used to analyze this dataset is the medium in which the post was posted on. The
two mediums in the source dimensions are Twitter and Facebook. People also rated the message judging
whether or not a particular message was neutral or partisan. This bar is measuring the amount of
messages.</p><p>Both sources have similar proportions in terms of bias to neutral and count of messages for each
type of message. However, Facebook overall has a higher rate of neutral messages compared to Twitter.
However both were judged to overall have more neutral messages compared to partisan messages. The largest
three messages for both sources were personal, policy, and support; however, Facebook had more of those
three proportionally compared to Twitter. Overall, Facebook is thought to have proportionally more
neutral messages and contain more personal, policy, and support messages compared to Twitter.</p><br/><hr/><br/><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/politics_social_media/PartisanPostingsDashboard?:language=en&amp;:display_count=y&amp;publish=yes&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="850"></iframe><h3 id="partisanship-and-location">Partisanship and Location</h3><p>This map shows how the percentage of partisan social media posts varies across the Untied States.
As we can see, some southern states including Georgia, Louisiana, Kentucky. and Utah have the
greatest percentage of partisan labelled social media posts. These states are known for being
relatively conservative and therefore leaning heavily towards the Republican party. Some states with
the smallest percentage of partisan posts include Arkansas, Delaware, and Nevada. I believe some
more information might be needed in order to determine the validity of these results by including
the amount of social media posts from each state. This is because a state may have a small amount
of posts and thus be a worse representation of the state as a whole.</p><br/><hr/><br/><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/shared/TFRN7CDWR?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="640"></iframe><h3 id="words-used-in-neutral-and-partisan-messages">Words used in neutral and partisan messages</h3><p>The visuals above are a general overview of the relationship between words used in a political text
and whether people perceive the message as neutral or partisan. Since I am not creating an algorithm
to calculate each word’s appearance in the dataset, I did my best to avoid making deceptive visuals.
What I did was manually filtered the messages by words representing different perspectives.
In conclusion, I want to show that it is hard to use word categories to accurately determine the
messages to be neutral or partisan even though trends are showing in particular words.</p><br/><hr/><br/><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/Work_Map_Version_Dashboard/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="600"></iframe><h3 id="wording-used-based-on-message-type-and-source">Wording used based on message type and source</h3><p>This graph depicts multiple key words used from the texts and posts, larger word sizes indicate
that the word was seen more in the posts and the opposite is true for smaller word sizes. This visualization
looks at the appearance of these words based on the messages shown. One can highlight and see if
the word is specific to one source, or a combination of both.</p><p>There are many key words depicted althroughout the different message types; some include key figures
such as Obama or common political key words such as “congress.” Some interesting observations to note
are: attack messages depicted more noun words compared to other message types, policy and support
do not have any common words unique to only one source, media contained the most unique political words.</p><br/><hr/><br/><h3 id="summary">Summary</h3><p>INSERT SUMMARY HERE</p><br/><hr/><br/><h2 id="sources">Sources</h2><p><span>Politcal Social Media Posts Dataset: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/political-social-media-posts">https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/political-social-media-posts</a></span></p><p><span>US Politicians Twitter Dataset: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/us-politicians-twitter-dataset">https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/us-politicians-twitter-dataset</a></span></p></div></div></div></div>
